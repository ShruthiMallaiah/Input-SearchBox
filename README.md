# Input-SearchBox

Search input box will search over a list of users using ReactJs. The project includes below features.

1.The search results will show up as a list of User Cards.<br/>
2. The list of cards can be navigated through keyboard or mouse. <br/>
3. When no search results are found, an empty card is displayed.<br />
4. The card list would be scrollable. <br/>
5. The highlighted card (via keyboard/mouse) will scroll into view.<br />

List of cards navigated through keyboard or mouse is handled by using Custom Hooks.

Custom hook is created using the concept called Roving Focus(https://a11y-solutions.stevenwoodson.com/solutions/focus/roving-focus/)

Roving Focus: Also known as "Roving tabindex", typically reserved for custom UI components that require manual focus management using tabindex.
